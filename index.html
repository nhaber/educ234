  <h2>Course Description</h2>

  <div id="coursedesc">
<p>How do we design artificial systems that learn as we do early in life -- as “scientists in the crib” who explore and experiment with our surroundings? How do we make AI "curious" so that it explores without explicit external feedback? Topics draw from cognitive science (intuitive physics and psychology, developmental differences), computational theory (active learning, optimal experiment design), and AI practice (self-supervised learning, deep reinforcement learning). Students present readings and complete both an introductory computational project (e.g. train a neural network on a self-supervised task) and a deeper-dive project in either cognitive science (e.g. design a novel human subject experiment) or AI (e.g. implement and test a curiosity variant in an RL environment).</p>

<p>Each student should walk away having learned something about both the cognition and artificial intelligence work behind curiosity, with some experience training neural networks. This will be facilitated by readings and project work. In addition, each student will develop a more in-depth project motivated in the cognition and AI of curiosity but specialized in at least one of AI, cognitive science, or education & design. This is intended to deliver a research product useful for the students’ longer-term objectives (e.g. germination of an AI conference submission, study design, or white paper for further education research). Through readings, students will gain the ability to evaluate the merits of an AI paper. Is the idea sound? Is the metric useful? Can this be applied in useful contexts?

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
This course is intended to attract a broad range of students interested in curiosity-driven learning in both people and artificial systems.
  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">Some prior experience coding is important, and prior experience working with data and machine learning is very useful.</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Willingness to dive into research papers in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence is critical. You need not be practiced at reading current AI research, but you should be at a point where you would like to learn.</li>

  <h2>Student responsibilities</h2>

  <div id="studentresp">

<h3>Readings and presentations</h3>
<p>Students will be responsible for readings covered in discussions (the primary ones; secondary are just there to be helpful), and we will take turns leading these discussions through presentations by assigned groups. Participation during discussions is a critical part of the class! Please see the <a href="readings.html">detailed syllabus and readings</a> for further details.</p>

<p>One week prior to the presentation, I will provide suggested discussion questions to the groups as a way to help scaffold. You'll be given a chance to modify these questions, and then I will announce the final version to the class ahead of the presentation. Come prepared to discuss! The presentation group must make the discussion a part of their presentation, which should be up to an hour (I will hold you to it!), with slides.</p>

<p>A subset of the readings will include pre-assignments, short discussion questions that you will contribute to before class time.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>The course project is intended to support diverse backgrounds and interests and can range widely. Many particulars are up to you, and we will help to find an appropriate topic and scope of work. Students can work solo or in groups (and we can help facilitate groups!). It consists of two main objectives.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">The primary goal of this is to support the cultivation of your interests in a way that is hopefully useful to you in the future (by directly developing a longer-term project of yours, or by helping you develop a skill...). As such, the main objective can be very broad, so long as it relates to the overall course content: developmentally-inspired AI, artificial systems that learn through interaction, the developmental psychology of curiosity, active (machine) learning, the study of how humans learn through interaction, etc.</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">The project can be primarily computational or non-computational in nature, but it must have a computational component. This, again, should relate in some way to course content, but it is intended to meet you where you are. As such, it can relate to some of the end-goals for course content (e.g. playing with intrinsically-motivated reinforcement learning) but it can also help you build up your background in machine learning & statistical analysis more broadly. This can relate, but need not relate, to your overall project objective.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Please see <a href="projects.html">here</a> for a detailed project milestone timeline and example project ideas.</p>

<h3>Attendance and discussion participation</h3>

<p>This course is in-person! We will have regular discussions, some of which will require your input, and this will contribute to your participation grade.</p>
