<h1>Project overview</h1>
<p>The course project is intended to support diverse backgrounds and interests and can range widely. Many particulars are up to you, and we will help to find an appropriate topic and scope of work. Students can work solo or in groups of two or three (and we can help facilitate groups!). It consists of two main objectives.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">The primary goal of this is to support the cultivation of your interests in a way that is hopefully useful to you in the future (by directly developing a longer-term project of yours, or by helping you develop a skill...). As such, the main objective can be very broad, so long as it relates to the overall course content: developmentally-inspired AI, artificial systems that learn through interaction, the developmental psychology of curiosity, active (machine) learning, the study of how humans learn through interaction, etc.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">The project can be primarily computational or non-computational in nature, but it must have a computational component. This, again, should relate in some way to course content, but it is intended to meet you where you are. As such, it can relate to some of the end-goals for course content (e.g. playing with intrinsically-motivated reinforcement learning) but it can also help you build up your background in machine learning & statistical analysis more broadly. This can relate, but need not relate, to your overall project objective. To be clear, if your primary objective is computational in nature, you do not need to have a separate "computational component."</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Milestones</h1>
<h2>April 6: project scoping pitch</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is both to get you all thinking about these early, start talking about them in class, and allow us to help with scoping from the start. In 1-2 paragraphs, describe the main idea, and if primarily non-computational, the computational component. By now, it would be useful to identify if you are working solo or with a group, and if a group, who is in that group (of two or three) -- though if that's not entirely certain just yet, please note that and your preference, and we can try to help.</p>

<h2>April 20: deeper-dive plan</h2>

<p>Reacting to feedback, update us with a more detailed plan: essential related work, and some particulars of what you would like to try, in a 1-2 page document (singling out the computational component, if necessary). Please provide a brief timeline of what you plan to do for the rest of the quarter (e.g. what you hope to get done on a weekly or biweekly basis).</p>

<h2>May 8: Project update</h2>
<p>Prepare a 10-minute slide presentation and record it as a video updating us on your progress thus far. Importantly, <b>some</b> progress must be made on the computational component by now -- tell us about your results! We'll make these videos available to the class, everyone will watch, and we'll discuss them on May 11.</p>

<h2>June 1: poster session & final reports due</h2>
<p>Pandemic-allowing, a final poster session! In addition, a 4-6 page paper laying out your project: motivation, related work, method, results, discussion (or some approximation of that which makes sense for this work).

<h1>Example projects (a very non-exhaustive list!)</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">Are you an active researcher in related topics? Let’s keep developing that.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">AI: Run a novel deep reinforcement learning experiment using a technique inspired by recent work on curiosity.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Developmental psychology: design a novel developmental psychology experiment, delivered as a grant proposal or a registered report.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Design: design a tool that measures or aids this sort of cognition, or uses these sorts of AI techniques, delivered as a prototype mockup.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Learning theories: conceptualize the computational theory curiosity as it relates to learning theories, delivered as a white paper on how to connect the two fields.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Learning environments: create a virtual learning environment, either for benchmarking an artificial system or for exploring human curiosity and interactive learning.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Active learning: try active learning approaches on a data domain of your choice.</span></li>
  </ul>

<h1>Example computational components (again, non-exhaustive!)</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">Broadly, any sort of work in AI/machine learning/data analysis that gets you towards your primary goal.</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Build up your skillset in a way that helps you move towards some of the computational techniques we cover in class: basics of machine learning, self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, active learning, etc. One great way to do this is to take existing tutorials and modify them in some way you find interesting. We will provide example tutorials — don’t hesitate to reach out for further suggestions!</span></li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Identify a dataset relevant to human curiosity, and analyze this through a statistical model. We will provide example datasets — but feel free to explore your own!</span></li>
  </ul>
